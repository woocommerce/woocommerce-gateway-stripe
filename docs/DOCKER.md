## Docker Local Setup

Docker can be used to setup a local development environment:

- Ensure Docker is installed ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is a good option for developers)
- From the root of this project, run `npm run up`
- The fully configured site can now be accessed on <http://localhost:8082>
- The prompt to run the setup wizard can be dismissed unless there is something specific you would like to configure

To shutdown:

- Use `npm run down` to stop the running containers
- The state of the environment will be persisted in `docker/wordpress` and `docker/data`. To restart the environment simply run `npm run up` again. To start afresh, delete these folders and let `npm run up` re-create them.

Known issues:

- The test commands cannot be executed when running with debug mode enabled.
