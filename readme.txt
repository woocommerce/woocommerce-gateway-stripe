Take credit card payments on your store using Stripe.

== Description ==

Accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, Diners Club, and more cards directly on your store with the Stripe payment gateway for WooCommerce.

= Take Credit card payments easily and directly on your store =

The Stripe plugin extends WooCommerce allowing you to take payments directly on your store via Stripe’s API.

Stripe is available in:

* United States
* Canada
* UK
* Australia
* Belgium
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* The Netherlands
* [and more](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-countries-does-stripe-support)

Stripe is a simple way to accept payments online. With Stripe you can accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club cards, even Bitcoin, directly on your store.

= Why choose Stripe? =

Stripe has no setup fees, no monthly fees, no hidden costs: you only get charged when you earn money! Earnings are transferred to your bank account on a 7-day rolling basis.

Stripe also supports the [Subscriptions extension](http://www.woothemes.com/extension/subscriptions/) and re-using cards. When a customer pays, they are set up in Stripe as a customer. If they create another order, they can check out using the same card. A massive timesaver for returning customers.

== Installation ==

Please note, v3 of this gateway requires WooCommerce 2.5 and above.

You can download an [older version of this gateway for older versions of WooCommerce from here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/developers/).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To
do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support recurring payments, like for subscriptions? =

Yes!

= Does this support both production mode and sandbox mode for testing? =

Yes it does - production and sandbox mode is driven by the API keys you use.
